## 2nd, 1st then 3rd

In sports, a type of podium can be used to honor the top three competitors in events. In the modern Olympics a tri-level podium is used. Traditionally, the highest platform is in the center for the gold medalist. To their right is a lower platform for the silver medalist, and to the left of the gold medalist is a lower platform for the bronze medalist.

### What does this mean?

It means if you are using a podium to showcase winners in your event, you should PROPERLY ORDER your podium so the second place finisher(s) are on the left, first place finisher(s) are in the middle and third place finisher(s) are on on the right. 

Second. First. Third.
